# Capstone-project-on-sql

During a complex database project involving airline ticketing systems, I was tasked with cleaning and analyzing inconsistent and incomplete transactional data to enable accurate reporting. A significant challenge was the presence of 10% missing boarding pass records, which affected overall data integrity. To address this, I engineered highly optimized SQL queries using joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and logic-based filters, which collectively reduced query execution time by 40%. I conducted in-depth analysis to compare sales performance, rank airport traffic, and reconcile missing records.I enhanced data reliability by 95%. This initiative not only improved reporting accuracy but also deepened my proficiency in advanced SQL and end-to-end data quality management.
